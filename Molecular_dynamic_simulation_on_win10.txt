Running Molecular Dynamic Simulation with Gromacs on Windows 10

Gromacs runs only on the command line, and you will need to install the 
Ubuntu app from MS store. 

After the installation, you will need to update the Ubuntu software
```
sudo apt get update
```

Update the ubuntu software 
```
sudo apt update
```

Upgrade the software after the update
```
sudo apt upgrade
```

run a C program on Ubuntu Linux using the gcc compiler 
```
sudo apt-get install gcc
```

CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files, and generate native makefiles
```
sudo apt-get install cmake
```

The build-essentials packages are meta-packages that are necessary for compiling software.
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

Library for computing Fast Fourier Transforms - development
```
sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev
```

GROMACS is one of the most widely used open-source and free software codes in chemistry, used primarily for dynamical simulations of biomolecules
```
sudo apt-get install gromacs
```

check for the installation 
```
gmx
```

MDS for pdbfile 
First download the Swiss-PdbViewer (https://spdbv.unil.ch/disclaim.html#)
View the pdb file in the SPDBV to add missing atoms. 
Select all then save the selection as .pdb file which you will use for MDS in Gromacs 

Running gromacs when there is no missing Hydrogen 
```
gmx pdb2gmx -f 2EW7-1JLE.pdb -o 1.gro -p 1.top -water spce
```

Removing missing Hydrogens 
```
gmx pdb2gmx -f mod.pdb -o 1.gro -p 1.top -water spce -ignh
```
